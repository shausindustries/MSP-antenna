# MSP-antenna
This project was developed on the Ansys Electronics software, which is a HFSS (High Frequency Simulator Software). 
The substrate which is used for conduction of waves is Taconic TLY-5 which is a glass fabric reinforced epoxy resin compound. It is developed for to work at 2.5 gHz frequency
These antennas can used in smartphones and for wireless communication
